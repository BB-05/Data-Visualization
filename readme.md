## Which dataset you chose?
### Ford GoBike System Data (Bay Wheels)
>Bay Wheels is a regional public bicycle sharing system in the San Francisco Bay Area, California operated by Motivate in a partnership with the Metropolitan Transportation Commission and the Bay Area Air Quality Management District. Bay Wheels is the first regional and large-scale bicycle sharing system deployed in California and on the West Coast of the United States.

## Main findings
>This project looks like a big success where lot o people are satisfied with the hight number of users we have proof. What is even better, that it is ecological, cheaper, healthier than cabs. From times it looks like the users are mostly working-class which using bikes to get to the work. Also, it can be a lot of tourists who are in town from eight to five, but I don't think so. 
During a weekend when people are work-free, bikes a little bit less occupied. We have a nice surprise where customers/subscribers have bikes for a long time and have long trips where the peak is around 10 km.
